# PacMan
This project will attempt to replicate the game "Pacman"

The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible. To do this, collect the orbs on the board without colliding with any ghosts. 
There are several "special" orbs on the board that will temporarily make all the ghosts on the board vulnerable.
Colliding with a ghost in it's vulnerable state will send it back to it's spawn point and award bonus points.
Upon collecting all of the orbs on the board, the game board will refresh but the score will be maintained.

<code>CONTROLS
W - move up
S - move down
D - move right
A - move left</code>

Pac man will continue in the input direction as long as there is space available (you don't need to hit a key for every space)
if pac man hits a wall, it will stop until another movement key is input

Enjoy!
